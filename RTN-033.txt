The In-kind Helpdesk System
Summary
We use Jira and the Jarvis auto-ticketer to implement an outward-facing Helpdesk system, with configuration and operating procedure designed for use by the Rubin LSST in-kind program contribution teams and recipients as they seek assistance from the In-kind Program Coordinators (IPC) in the Rubin operations IPC Team. The system follows an initial design by the Rubin construction project Communications  (COMT) and IT teams.  This technote describes the system and its use.

Document Title
1. Introduction
This document is a technical guide to the use of the In-kind Helpdesk System by the IPC team members. It covers the handling of new submitted tickets, the handling of assigned tickets, and the review of resolved tickets. 
An essential role in In-kind Helpdesk (IKH) support is the IPC member on support duty.  This role’s primary responsibilities are to monitor new tickets submitted to the helpdesk, assign tickets to the most appropriate IPC member, and provide any first-order response to general queries. This role is also responsible for rejecting and spam/inappropriate tickets. This role also serves as the reviewer for most resolved helpdesk tickets. 
The IPC member currently assigned this role can be found at the Rubin LSST In-kind Program Helpdesk Support Duty Sheet.
